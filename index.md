# About Me

<img src="wsd_pku.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Shaodong Wang (Mercado, 王少东)**.<br>

I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Long Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/longchen). I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and my master’s degree at the School of Electronic and Computer Engineering at Peking University, where I was advised by [Prof. Li Yuan](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2678.htm).

Prior to joining HKUST, I conducted research in artificial intelligence and generative models under the guidance of Prof. Li Yuan at Peking University. My research primarily focuses on AIGC and unified models, including text-to-image generation, text-to-video synthesis, and image editing.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **shaodong_jerry [at] 163.com**
